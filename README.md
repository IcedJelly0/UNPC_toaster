Hello there (:

What is this: It detects the color of bread from the webcam and triggers a servo when its done. This is the fist time I've done web development
Edit: I might host it online soon

How to Use:
1) Download and Extract the files to a folder on your raspberry
2) Plug in your servo and change what pins you use in servoControl.py
3) Make Sure you have a usb camera plugged in the raspberry pi
4) Open index.html on the raspberrypi's browser
5) Allow camera access
6) Open JSPythonLink.txt using folder icon near color data
7) Open servoControl.py
8) Drill a hole in your toaster and shove the camera inside
9) Enjoy perfect toast
10) Tell all your friends about youtube.com/@unpcshow
