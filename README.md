Hello there (:

What is this: It detects the color of bread from the webcam and triggers a servo when its done. This is the fist time I've done web development
Edit: I might host it online soon

How to Use:
1) Download and Extract the files to a folder on your raspberry
2) Make Sure you have a usb camera plugged in the raspberry pi
3) Open index.html or use the [online version](https://joedotmt.github.io/unpctoaster) on the raspberrypi
4) Allow camera access
5) Open JSPythonLink.txt using folder icon (on the website)
6) Attach the servo to the side of the toaster in a way which when it rotates it presses the release toast button
7) Plug in your servo to the raspberry pi
8) Edit servoControl.py and change the pins that are in the program to the pins that you plugged the servo into
9) Run servoControl.py (from the folder you extracted)
10) Drill a hole in your toaster and shove the camera inside
11) Enjoy perfect toast
12) Tell all your friends about youtube.com/@unpcshow
