Hello there (:

What is this: 
It detects the color of bread from the webcam and triggers a servo when its done. 

This is the fist time I've done web development or really any programming at all apart from gamemaker

How to Use:
1) Download and Extract the files to a folder on your raspberry pi
2) Make Sure you have a usb camera plugged in the raspberry pi
3) Open index.html or use the [online version](https://joedotmt.github.io/unpctoaster) on the raspberry pi
4) Allow camera access
5) When on the website cLick the folder icon and choose JSPythonLink.txt from the files you previously extracted
6) Attach the servo to the side of the toaster in a way which when it rotates it presses the release toast button
7) Plug in your servo to the raspberry pi
8) Edit servoControl.py and change the pins that are in the program to the pins that you plugged the servo into
9) Run servoControl.py (from the folder you extracted)
10) Drill a hole in your toaster and shove the camera inside
11) Enjoy perfect toast
12) Tell all your friends about youtube.com/@unpcshow
